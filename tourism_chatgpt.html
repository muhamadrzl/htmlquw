        <h1>Visiting Kediri Regency in East Java Province</h1>
        <p>In East Java Province, tourists have many good vacation destinations including Kediri Regency. The location is a little bit far from Surabaya City (the capital of the province), though. The fact is Kediri becomes the third biggest city in the region and has lots of interesting tourist sites including monuments, natural attractions, recreational areas, historical places, and traditional villages. However, tourists won’t find beaches there. Another interesting fact is the city becomes the biggest producer of cigarettes and sugar! No wonder, the popularity is excellent and tourists are interested to visit it over time.</p>

            <strong>The Nuance</strong>
            <br> 
            <p>As mentioned before, Kediri Regency indeed is wide and it has a total area of about 6,340 hectares. It passes through by the famous Brantas River and resides on the feet of a volcano called Wilis Mountain. The environment is fine and tourists can find some good highlands for trekking there. What about the locals? People who live in Kediri come from numerous tribes including Arabian and Chinese, in fact! As for the facilities and accommodations, the quality is excellent. Kediri is considered a developed region, after all. </p>
          
            <strong>Exploring Kediri Regency</strong>
            <br>
            <p>Some people perhaps wonder what they can do in Kediri during holidays. Well, these include religious and natural tourism. Most tourists also want to enjoy local cuisine and a family recreation there. For those who love nature and adventure, in this case, they should choose Pojok Village where the famous Selomangleng Cave resides. As an alternative, tourists can visit some historical sites like temples, museums, and monuments. Some of the best choices are Setono Gedong Temple, Tjio Hwie Kiong Vihara, and Airlangga Museum. For the best reference, it is recommended to ask either a local guide or tour agent there.</p>
